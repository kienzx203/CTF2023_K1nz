      <h2>&emsp;Welcome to The DEW</h2>
      <img class="main" src="/images/toroidal_earth.png" alt="The Toroid">
      <p class="main">Venerated Visitor,</p>
      <p class="main">
        &emsp;Welcome to the <b>Donut Earth Wiki</b>, otherwise known as <b>The DEW</b>. This website is
        dedicated to unraveling the true mysteries of the universe and demonstrating that the earth is a <b>donut</b>
        and that <i>Round</i> and <i>Flat Earth</i> doctrines are little more than elaborate hoaxes.
        </br>
        </br>
        &emsp;The <b>Donut Earth Society</b> has dedicated itself to starting science afresh from the ground up, to
        begin to see the world without bias and assumption. Experiment and experience has shown that the earth
        is decidedly shaped like a delectable donut. Time and time again through test, trial, and experiment,
        it has been shown that the earth is not a whirling globe of popular credulity, but an endless toros of
        times immaterial.
        </br>
        </br>
        &emsp;Much of the firm and well-thought evidence for a <b>Toroidal Earth</b> is provided by the esteemed Varaug, a
        modern day forum user of FlatEarthSociety.org who should be giving lectures at the prominent universities
        of the day. His circumstantial evidence is very easily understandable and requires only common sense
        to conclude that we live on the <i>"tastiest celestial body, our sugar-glazed planet Earth."</i> As eloquently
        put by the esteemed Varaug, <i>"Imagine a donut. Imagine a jam donut. Gravity acts towards the jam."</i> More
        such wisdom can be found <a href="https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=54383.0">here</a>.
        </br>
        </br>
        &emsp;Throughout the years it has become a duty of each Donut Earth Society member, to meet the common
        <i>Round</i> and <i>Flat Earthers</i> in the open, avowed, and unyielding rebellion; to declare that their reigns of
        error and confusion are over; and that henceforth, like a falling dynasty, they must shrink and
        disappear, leaving the throne and the kingdom of science and philosophy to those awakening intellects
        whose numbers are constantly increasing, and whose march is rapid and irresistible. The soldiers of
        truth and reason of the <b>Donut Earth Society</b> have drawn the sword, and ere another generation has been
        educated and grown to maturity, will have forced the usurpers to abdicate. Like the decayed and
        crumbling trees of an ancient forest, rent and shattered by wind and storm, the hypothetical
        philosophies, which have hitherto cumbered the civilized world, are unable to resist the elements of
        experimental and logical criticism; and sooner or later must succumb to their assaults. The spear is
        reared for a final strike - it is about to fall through the primitive sphere of the earth, and the blow
        will surely <i>"pierce the cumberer through!"</i>
