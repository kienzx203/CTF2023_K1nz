## Description

My flag checker is so inefficient that Python can't run it QAQ

## Solution

$$
f(x) = \frac{1x+3}{3x+7}
$$

is known as Mobius transformation, which can be written as a matrix 

$$
M =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
3 & 7
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It is easy to verify that $f \circ f$ is same as $M \times M$, and

$$
f(\frac{x}{y}) = \frac{1x+3y}{3x+7y}
$$

is essentially

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
3 & 7
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can see the connection between $f$ and a $2 \times 2$ matrix, so we can compute

$$
M^{-n}
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{target} \\
1
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And $r = uv^{-1} \pmod{p}$.

But the $n=2^{2^{1337}}$ is really big, even using a fast modular exponentiation algorithm $\log(n)=2^{1337}$ is still not feasible.

The trick is to notice that $M$ is in $GL_2(F_p)$, so the group order is $\text{od} = (p^2-1)(p^2-p)$ and we have $M^n = M^{n \mod{od}}$. Since $\text{od}$ isn't much larger than $p$, we can easily get the $r$ now.

Now we have

$$
\frac{x}{y} \equiv r \pmod{p}
$$

Muliply both sides by $y$ and remove the modulo, we get

$$
x=ry+kp
$$

Note that both $x,y$ are half of the flag, so $0 < x,y < 2^{128}$. The following lattice

$$
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
r & 1 \\
p & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

have a short vector $(x,y)$, which can be found by LLL.

## Alternative Solution for the last part

From

$$
\frac{x}{y} \equiv r \pmod{p}
$$

we know that

$$
x r^{-1} \equiv y \pmod{p}
$$

Remove the modulus, we get

$$
x r^{-1} = y + kp \approx kp
$$

Rearrange it we get

$$
\frac{x}{k} \approx \frac{p}{r^{-1}}
$$

The error is

$$
\frac{y}{k r^{-1}} < \frac{1}{2k^2}
$$

So $\frac{x}{k}$ is a convergents of $\frac{p}{r^{-1}}$, and we can approxiate it by continued fraction.
